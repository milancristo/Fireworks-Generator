SparkLab - Interactive Fireworks Generator 🎆

A visually stunning, physics-based fireworks simulation built with HTML5 Canvas and Vanilla JavaScript. SparkLab offers a fully interactive experience where users can create their own light shows or sit back and watch an autonomous display.

✨ Features

Interactive Canvas: Click, tap, or drag anywhere on the screen to launch fireworks at specific coordinates. Multi-touch support included for mobile devices.

Real-time Physics Control: A floating control panel lets you tweak the simulation engine on the fly:

Particle Count: Adjust density from sparse sparkles to massive explosions.

Explosion Power: Control the velocity and spread of the burst.

Gravity: Simulate moon-like floatiness or heavy planetary pull.

Friction: Adjust air resistance to change how quickly particles slow down.

Visual Styles: Choose from 6 distinct color palettes and behaviors:

Classic, Pastel, Gold, Electric, Neon, and Fire.

Auto-Fire Mode: Toggle an automated show that runs in the background.

Visual Effects: Options for long exposure trails and shockwave visualizers.

Responsive Design: Fully fluid layout that adapts to any screen size or orientation.

🚀 Getting Started

Since this project is built as a single-file application, running it is incredibly simple.

Prerequisites

A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

An internet connection (required to load Tailwind CSS via CDN).

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/fireworks-generator.git](https://github.com/yourusername/fireworks-generator.git)


Navigate to the project folder.

Open fireworks_generator.html directly in your browser.

Alternatively, you can simply download the HTML file and double-click it.

🎮 Controls

Control

Action

Left Click / Tap

Launch a rocket to the cursor position.

Auto-Fire Toggle

Enable/Disable the automatic background show.

Sliders/Inputs

Adjust specific physics variables (Gravity, Power, etc.).

Style Buttons

Switch the color palette and particle behavior.

Clear Sky

Instantly remove all active particles from the screen.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 Canvas: For high-performance rendering of particles.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): Core logic, physics engine, and DOM manipulation.

Tailwind CSS: Used via CDN for rapid UI styling of the control panel.

🔮 Future Improvements

[ ] Add sound effects for launches and explosions.

[ ] Save/Load custom preset configurations.

[ ] 3D particle effects using WebGL.
